Binged on Netflix. Had two machine made pancakes for breakfast. Walked over to get my tick medicine for the grand total of $4.95. Then walked around Ashland a bit, cleaned gear, and hung out by the pool.

Now at the Mexican restaurant drinking Margaritas and eating fajitas.

Did go to the hotel gym. Three weeks where only upper body exercise was to pole propel myself up hills and lift the backpack… combined with a huge calorie deficiency. Good thing my love of my life isn’t in it for my hunkness. Got the best calves in the business though. 

In the lack of mental fortitude, go home early division. I applied to a trail crew on the CDT in Colorado! Not heard back yet.
