Maryann and Bob drove me all the way up to Burney Falls. Five hours! They are angels. 

Then a hot hike for about 15km. Nice slow start. The trail thread is really soft and nice on the feet. From the visitor center at the falls the path meandered gently through the forest. Crossed a hydro power dam at Lake Britton where they were doing refurbishment so I had to be escorted across. Terrain shifted between pine forest and something akin to desert. Met man’s best friend the rattlesnake on two occasions. At least that’s what I think it was. No rattling, but gave me a good scare still. 

Camped here with two others, at a small trickle of a spring.

It was exciting to finally get started. The first days are always weird. A mix of home sickness and worries about what lays ahead. 

Ms M: ligger i lille Persille og alt er bra! Måtte gå rundt to klapperslanger som solte seg på stien idag. Veldig varmt og ingen som selger is. Maryann bakte verdens beste amerikanske sjokolade cookies til meg.
