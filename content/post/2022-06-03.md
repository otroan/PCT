Jetlag is a good thing in the morning. Woke up at 5am. Need some more time working in the packing routine, didn’t get going before 7am. 

Walking in the woods today, with some places opening up and offering some views. Lots of beautiful wild flowers. The trail mostly undulating between 1500-1600m elevation. 

Now camped at 1650. Alone. Realized I might have put the tent in an old burn zone. Let’s hope the trees around me continue standing upright. 

It just started raining so I am warm and cozy in the sleeping bag. Weather forecast indicates rain for the next couple of days. 

Got passed by “Sloppy Joe” today, who is the first one I have met who started from Campo at the Mexican border.
