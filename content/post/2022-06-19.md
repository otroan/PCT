Woke up, had the rest of the granola I carried from Etna and was on the trail at 0650. Just 50 minutes after Zeb. 

Today was just to get down to Callahan Lodge for breakfast. Just 13km down the valley. Easy and fast trail. 

When there, hot a small uninteresting breakfast from a waitress who could in many ways have been better suited for the job. 

This morning I noticed a bull’s eye tick bite, so going to the local health clinic. Mostly as an exercise in testing the US health system. 

Zeb got the remaining tuna packets, extra charge from my power bank and we said our farewells as he was continuing north with 30 miles each and every day.

Done about 11% of the trail now. More if we subtract the 150 miles fire closure north in Oregon.

Sitting outside the laundry room at the Ashland Best Western waiting for my clothes to dry.

Will I get back on the trail or will I go home? You will get to know in next episode of “Ole does America”.
