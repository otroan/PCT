## The plan

The *original* plan was to walk a pure PCT Southbound hike. And I have a permit for that starting from the Canadian border June 29th.
There is a lot of snow up in Washington and Oregon this year, and as a way to both get a softer and easier start to get my trail legs, and to avoid crowds, I have decided to start in the middle, in Burney Falls in Northern California and hike north. Then when reaching the border to Canada, where hopefully my good Canadian friend Steve is handing out some provisions, I will turn back and then get down to Burney and continue south.

I will fly out to the US on Tueday the 31st, get my gear together and then go up to Burney on Thursday the 2nd.
