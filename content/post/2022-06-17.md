Got up packed everything and went over to the cafe with Bill. A few of the locals already there. They did not acknowledge us. Btw, this part of California has a separation movement, trying to create their own state. Jefferson state. 

The ham and cheese omelette with hash browns and toast was really good. The portions so massive that it’s a struggle eating much more than half. Still not hungry even though my garmin tells me I have burnt 4600 kcals today. 

Bill wasn’t hiking today, cause he didn’t like to walk in the rain. Halfway through breakfast another hiker arrives. Zebediah(?) from New Zealand. He was on a mission to finish the PCT before August 1 and have to do 30 mile days every day.

It was cloudy and foggy most of the day, with sometimes heavy rain shovers. Fresh snow on the ground too. Often it can be 35C in Seiad Valley, now it was 15 down there abd below freezing at night up at 1900 meters where we are.

Zeb and I chatted most of the day and the 38km passed quickly. Cold and miserable so that was as well. 

Unsure if I will try to match his 30 miles tomorrow or not. I will take a breather and a think in Ashland. About 39 miles to there and only 12.5miles to Oregon!
