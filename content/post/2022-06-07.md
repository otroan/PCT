Slept worse in the hotel bed than in the tent. Must have been that electricity and Netflix are worse for your sleep than the fear of being mauled by bears.

Replaced a few things in the local outdoor shop. In the quest to lighten the load, I shipped a box of stuff to Bob, replaced the fas canister with a small one, cut the sleeping pad in two etc.
Should I be grateful that the mice lightened the walking sticks by chewing off the corkhandles?

Very friendly people around here, and a good selection of shops and restaurants. Tourist industry geared towards people hiking up on Shasta. Yesterday I got it in my head that they had helicopter sightseeing of the mountain, because there was a helicopter flying back and to all the time. Turns out there were two independent parties being rescued. Fatalities and injuries. Snow conditions have become unpredictable over the last years. 
Seems people I speak to volunteer themselves an acceptance of climate change. So far I haven’t dared probing them on they think it’s being caused by human activity.
