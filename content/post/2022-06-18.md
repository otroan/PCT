Didn’t feel like I slept too well so was hard to get up when the alarm clock rang at 0530. Zeb was off at 0600, I didn’t leave before 0647. It had snowed quite a bit all night. Slept with my water filter to avoid it freezing. 

Packed up and left quickly. Was a walking machine for the first 16km. Averaging 5.6km/h. Caught up with Zeb and we walked together for the rest of the day. 

Cold all day with snow showers, and when it started to thaw all the snow and ice would fall from the trees in big chunks. Didn’t think I needed a helmet!

First 30 miles / 50k day today. Aching all over. Also some coolers with drinks left for PCT hikers. That was nice. 

Still around freezing, so not much snowmelt going on I would think. 

Laying in sleeping bag smelling my socks from the other end of tent…
