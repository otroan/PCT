Had breakfast with a couple from Colorado. She had participated in creating the 500 mile Colorado Trail back in the 80s. 

Slept like a log. Trains are good. 

Sitting in my little cubicle fixing my feet and listening to music, volume at 11. Looking out at this dry crazy Utah landscape. 

The train is only two hours delayed. Which means I will miss my ride. Only 30km plus to the trail head, so if it comes to it I can just walk. 

They now just announced we are passing Ruby canyon on the Colorado river with a lot of kayakers. Apparently it’s the tradition that they will moon the train. Can’t hold my breath.

And indeed they were mooning. Lunch with a couple in their twenties. And a selfie with chief conductor Codie.
